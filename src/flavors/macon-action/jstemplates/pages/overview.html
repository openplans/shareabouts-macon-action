<h1>Macon's urban core is changing in exciting ways.</h1>

<p>Do you have a favorite area in Downtown Macon? A favorite block or business, restaurant or route that you love to walk? Do you find yourself thinking about the next great opportunity for Downtown and intown neighborhoods? Do you have ideas to share? If so, we need to hear from you.</p>

<p>Macon's urban core is changing in exciting ways. New lofts are attracting more Downtown residents. New retail and restaurants are repopulating storefronts, generating foot traffic and making Downtown buzz with activity. Streetscape improvements now underway on Cherry and 2nd Streets will make the urban core more walkable and beautiful, a perfect backdrop for new placemaking initiatives that will celebrate and build community within the urban core's unique public realm.</p>

<p>Amidst this positive change and momentum, the Macon-Bibb County Urban Development Authority [UDA], the City of Macon, and their partners are undertaking a comprehensive planning process to envision the future for Downtown and intown neighborhoods and guide change moving forward.</p>

<p>The Macon Action Plan [MAP] invites all members of the public to help shape this plan for Macon's urban core. The plan's success depends first on your input and ideas, and ultimately upon a committed group of local stakeholders dedicated to making the Macon Action Plan our reality. Please get involved and stay involved!</p>
